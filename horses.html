    <h1>Horses</h1>
				<p>Hey, she ranted about her dream
        <br>all those algorithms, so much math
        <br>"damn, I knew you were smart, but I didn't know this smart!"
				<br>She spoke of so many principles, and with so much enthusiasm.
        <br>Her light shines in me.
        <br>Hey, when we listened to <i>lemon</i>,
        <br>she said, I wish someone said that to me.
        <br>Well I think I just might, if she wasn't right here beside me.
        <br>I jumped into your eyes for just a second, I think.
        <br>then I came up, gasping for air.
        <br>I wonder how you came upon that book,
        <br>how you recite poetry so freely.
        <br>And M'Choakumchild said, do not wonder,
        <br>and I made a rebuttal.
        <br>You dote on death too much, and you lack concision.
        <br>I can't possibly picture you in my mind.
      </p>
