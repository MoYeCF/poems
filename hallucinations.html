    <h1>Hallucinations</h1>
				<p>I can see you standing in the dark,
        <br>your glowing eyes, observing, wondering
        <br>if I was there, or if I was merely,
				<br>merely a fragment that your mind created.
				<br>And I say, I assure you, I've been there,
				<br>you're real, but you blink, and I dissappear again.
				<br>
				<br>You see, I've been with you, when you were 5 and started watching Ultraman, when you were 10 and rode a plane for the first time, when you were 13, unsure of your place in this world, hesitating; I was there, I was with you, I taught you my ways to cope with it all. And now, I stand in the light, and I blink, and you dissappeared, and you left me in PHOSPHOR.
