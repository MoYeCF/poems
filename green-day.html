    <h1>Green Day</h1>
				<p>"Drones in the classroom,
        <br>crickets ring, pass the old;
        <br>Spinning, the spoon broken in half,
        <br>Time spent in silence, the fire
        <br>crackles and burns.
        <br>A graceful shoemaker
        <br>flips and falls,
        <br>sticks to my skin,
        <br>tiny bumps granting me forsaken comfort.
        <br>A flick of the wrist,
        <br>How do you know? Me duele,
        <br>Trembling, tracing the raised edges
				<br>of hope.
