    <h1>Réveil</h1>
				<p>Aubade: various modes by which the amorous subject finds upon waking that he is once again beseiged by the anxieties of his passion.
				<br>
				<br>I woke up in a puddle of sweat
				<br>under a pie of sticks
				<br>my heart skidded down the hill
				<br>my heels are raw, I can't eat
				<br>
				<br>it never stopped
				<br>(flip a coin)
<br>
<br>Roland Barthes, "A Lover's Discourse," 203.
