    <h1>Jargon</h1>
				<p>As I kiss your eyes closed
        <br>I reach into your sleeves
        <br>and trace the crevices of your back
        <br>I feel you rushing my cheek
        <br>And I lace my fingers in your hair
        <br>And touch your hot scalp
        <br>and press you closer
        <br>I drink your tears
        <br>caress the back of your ear
        <br>nibble on your neck
        <br>As I hold the left side of your face
			<br>and my thumb comes
      <br>dangerously close to your eye
      <br><i>Almost</i>
      <br>I've come to associate that word with you
      <br>Till now
      <br>
      <br>You leave me wishing for more
      </p>
