    <h1>Pieces of Lyrics I can remember (fever) (blackout poetry)</h1>
				<p>you
        <br>never
        <br>suffering
        <br>shining
        <br>like a star
        <br>Laughting,
        <br>You spat it out.
        <br>silly gravity,
        <br>Alleluyah.
        <br>a dream
        <br>I loved it all,
        <br>A promise
        <br>no matter
        <br>where
        <br>I see it in my dream
        <br>of
        <br>heavy
        <br>heart
        <br>It
        <br>ended.
      </p>
