    <h1>Potin</h1>
				<p>gossip: pain suffered by the amorous subject when he finds that the loved being is the subject of "gossip" and hears that being discussed promiscuously.
				<br>
				<br>I understand
				<br>why you avoid me
				<br>Lay me bare
				<br>like petrified wood
				<br>as life moves
				<br>
        <br>Roland Barthes, "A Lover's Discourse," 183.
