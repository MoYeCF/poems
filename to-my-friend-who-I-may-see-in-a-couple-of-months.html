    <h1>To my friend who I may see in a couple of months</h1>
				<p>A great scene of separation and fulfilment.
					<br>I can live for you.
					<br>for when you put me in a haze
					<br>and pull me out of it, you sharpen
					<br>the world.
					<br>And as I look for that song I knew
					<br>you would like, but I keep finding ristrictions,
					<br>you are there. You are there.
					<br>And I know because I gave my heart to you,
					<br>and our paths diverged, but you have my
					<br>trust, and we will meet again, and I will
					<br>show you some things of mine, and you me of yours.
					<br>Sometimes you are so out of reach that I doubt your
					<br>existence. But we will meet in hell when the time comes.
					<br>Maybe you control my world. Maybe that sickening
					<br>feeling is your cry for help. Maybe it is all by
					<br>your arrangement, by your admission.
					<br>Sometimes I feel like a tool, but it vanishes
					<br>as I descend the stairs.
					<br>Sometimes I feel like your hug will live the burden off my shoulders.
					<br>For when the scale goes sideways, you are in favor of life,
					<br>and you save me. 
					<br>You are the only possibility.
					<br>A wind blew and lifted my arm. Shivers down, all the way to my heel. The gaps will be filled by condensation. No matter how log it will take. like a hand-cranked belt sander. Take care of yourself.
