    <h1>Multiple Choice</h1>
				<p>"Take the right way,
        <br>make your decision----"
        <br>yes or no? Yes or No?
        <br>I made myself clear, but
        <br>do you listen? Do you understand?
        <br>or is it like a praying mantis
        <br>amongst elephants, a mere,
        <br>fleeting thought?
        <br>I don't know what I will do
        <br>if you lose the world again.
        <br>Believe in your immune system,
        <br>ignore the snail trail up your arm----
				<br>maybe it's a placebo, it must be,
				<br>are you crazy? There's no way!
        <br>"Do I really, Must I, must I choose?----"
				<br>Yes, this is. That or That, either one
				<br>Rips you apart from the inside,
				<br>you shrivel up, you don't face it,
				<br>you can't choose, a mere metaphor,
