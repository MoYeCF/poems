  <h3>Multiple Choice</h3>
  <p>"Take the right way,
	<br>make your decision----"
	<br>yes or no? Yes or No?
	<br>I made myself clear, but
	<br>do you listen? Do you understand?
	<br>or is it like a praying mantis
	<br>amongst elephants, a mere,
	<br>fleeting thought?
	<br>I don't know what I will do
	<br>if you lose the world again.
	<br>Believe in your immune system,
	<br>ignore the snail trail up your arm----
	<br>maybe it's a placebo, it must be,
	<br>are you crazy? There's no way!
	<br>"Do I really, Must I, must I choose?----"
	<br>Yes, this is. That or That, either one
	<br>Rips you apart from the inside,
	<br>you shrivel up, you don't face it,
	<br>you can't choose, a mere metaphor,
	<br>life is short but so is your peepee,
	<br>butterfly effect. Would everything be the same
	<br>again, if I turned my back and left?</p>

	<br>yes or no? Yes or No?
	<br>I made myself clear, but
	<br>do you hear? Do you understand?
	<br>or is it like a nother animal
	<br>amongst elephants, a mere,
	<br>fleeting thought?
	<br>I don't know what I will do
	<br>if you lose the world again.
	<br>Believe in hydrate or dydrate,
	<br>ignore the snail trail; fails
	<br>only when the immune systen wails.
	<br>I take my fluoxetine every PM,
	<br>It's just I can't wait until I see them.
	<br>20mgs every day,
	<br>I fuckin slay all day.
	<br>Maybe it's a placebo, I can't tell;
	<br>are you crazy? There's no way!
	<br>"Daja, no way"
	<br>My insides are combusting,
	<br>Bleeding, no way!
	<br>Rips you apart from the inside,
	<br>you shrivel up, you don't face it,
	<br>you can't choose, a mere metaphor,
	<br>Boom, Take your meds,
	<br>Don't worry, Turn your back
	<br>for all you lack
	<br>is of no prospect.
