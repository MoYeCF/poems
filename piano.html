    <h1>Piano</h1>
				<p>I opened your letter this afternoon
        <br>and I was overjoyed. It was a long time
        <br>but it felt like a few seconds since I'd seen your face.
        <br>and I rushed to get stamps; I need to write back.
        <br>
				<br>Sometimes you look at me and I wonder if you can see the nausea.
        <br>I regurgitate it on paper, but I'd haven a flash recently-not,
        <br>and you asked me why I stopped writing,but I just pretended you
				<br>didn't exist.
				<br>
				<br>Sometimes I let it settle and my fingers bleed on the piano, and I slam the keys, and I go as fast as you can, to stir up the dust of my heart like you did. I smear the blood everywhere. It smells pungent.
				<br>
				<br>Other times I excised my hatred through control, and I would start weak and end weak. That's when I talk to myself: I will slit my wrists open if I make a mistake on this Act. But the pads of my fingers adapt, and that's when I let my body sway, and that's when you ask me if I want to do a chapel performance one day, and that's when I grimace and say, oh, I don't have enough practice, but we both know why.
				<br>
				<br>Through you I've learned to bottle-up my emotions again. Through you I've recovered the year before. Through you my wound was filled with concrete. Through you I felt strength, and through you I felt violence.
				<br>
				<br>You asked me what day I'll be back. Oh, you have a sweet sixteen that day. It's okay, and I send you the pictures of dango I had. And I get reminded on that time we had a towel, and how I clawed the towel, and how I wanted it to rip, and how it never did.
				<br>
				<br>You've sent me in a haze and I am lost, I am floating. I'm not sure if I can step down, and it felt semipermanent. But instead of yore all I have left for you is disgust, an unfortunate feeling. You feel like broccoli-on-pizza out-of-place. I can recover from this one, and I hear you telling you, and I broke a sweat. Beads forming, I have a migraine now, and you ran a nail through my head.
