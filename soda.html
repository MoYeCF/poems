    <h1>Soda</h1>
				<p>When some of the moisture have not yet evaporated,
        <br>dip your thumb halfway into the opening of a can of seltzer;
        <br>press down, if you dare. Channel the gears of the mundane,
        <br>and squeeze down on it, until you can barely feel.
        <br>In one fell swoop, swish your second digit toward you.
        <br>Harvest and savour the glory as your skin flakes.
        <br>Sometimes there is blood, which means you can't throw for a few days,
        <br>but just control it.
        <br>Oh, and be sure to squeeze. Hard. Empty the tip of your thumb.
        <br>Do not wipe it off. You might get someone HIV. Suck on it, instead.
        <br>Run yourself dry. The burn will turn to satisfaction. You have healed again.
