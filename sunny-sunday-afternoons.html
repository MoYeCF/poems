    <h1>Sunny, Sunday Afternoons</h1>
				<p>We went cafe-hopping once,
				<br>looking for dessert, clocks, renaissance paintings.
				<br>We stopped by Michael's, because I wanted to experiment,
				<br>and you wanted to make something for your girlfriend.
				<br>
				<br>We met at the station:
				<br>you lept into my arms.
				<br>and I staggered and hugged you tight.
				<br>I looked up, and I saw the worry in your body.
				<br>Instead I laughted with you at all the mishaps our schools experienced,
				<br>summarizing our lives in a touch of the heels.
				<br>We rode the LIRR to West Village
				<br>where we sprinted up the stairs
				<br>on the balcony, where we could see everything.
				<br>And the wind blew your hair back.
				<br>When I blinked you were looking at me, through those lenses tinted red
				<br>(so fashionista). I leaned in, to get a better look.
				<br>But I saw your eyes, and the way you were looking at me, and I swallowed
				<br>my question, and took a sip of my rasperry soda, instead.
				<br>I looked at the Manhattan skylines, where your dreams reside.
				<br>You asked me, what should you do when you feel backed into a corner?
				<br>And I didn't want to answer, fearing what I would say, but my lips quivered,
				<br>and you knew me too well. You had your answer.
				<br>So you averted your eyes, and I shivered, and I opened my mouth,
				<br>but nothing came out.
				<br>
				<br>We never sat in silence.
