    <h1>hate, hate, hate</h1>
				<p>Maybe with me gone
        <br>you can run along
        <br>with others, and roam your era
        <br>of glory and paste.
        <br>Maybe with me gone,
        <br>they won't be so hesitant
        <br>in existing around me.
        <br>Maybe with me gone
        <br>he won't be disturbed.
        <br>Maybe with me gone,
        <br>no one will get bit.
        <br>Maybe with me gone
        <br>she can finally be freed from the shackles
        <br>of her own wrongdoing.
        <br>Maybe with me gone
        <br>they won't have to pretend to like me.
        <br>Maybe with me gone
        <br>I won't feel hungry anymore.
        <br>buzzcut<br>with me gone
        <br>we will toil alone
        <br>with me gone
        <br>he...um...
        <br>with me gone
        <br>there won't be anyone to hug
        <br>with me gone
        <br>she...um...
        <br>with me gone
        <br>they won't laugh
        <br>with me gone
        <br>the story will never be finished
        <br>So I must stay,
        <br>and stay strong
        <br>until the day comes
        <br>when I can, of my own accord,
				<br>leave at last
      </p>
