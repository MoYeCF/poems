    <h1>Loneliness</h1>
				<p>There is a hole
        <br>which nothing can fit
        <br>but you
        <br>and I confide in you this
        <br>and I believe you're the only one
        <br>who can, not will.
        <br>So I guess now it will remain
        <br>open, open but closed, never closed?
        <br>until I hold you in my arms
        <br>and I land on solid ground.
