				<p>He lived sixty-one years,
        <br>useless colors floating above ice.
        <br>Come here, and dance with me,
				<br>Crinkling piercing waves at the tip of my newl,
				<br>flowing substance, surface tension.
				<br>"I don't do that anymore."
				<br>No, what you meant to say:
				<br>"We don't do that anymore."
				<br>Downward reflection,
				<br>upturned nose;
				<br>Awareness, acute,
				<br>awkward, honored, beloved;
				<br>Synced to the rain.
