    <h1>Windows</h1>
				<p>I turn into Clay under your somber gaze,
        <br>so blue, so transluscent, so fragile.
        <br>I can see your thoughts.
        <br>And when the light hits
        <br>Just right,
        <br>7,
        <br>8,
        <br>9.----
        <br>Pools! Who have I left to love?
