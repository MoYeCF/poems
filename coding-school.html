				<p>And I had a fire burning in my gut.
				<br>You asked, "so... ___ what is your type?" and you looked
				<br>at me. And I passed it off with a joke.
				<br>But I felt greasy inside, like a rat was scrambling my heart.
				<br>I made lists to calm me down,
				<br>and I pondered our differences;
				<br>I outlined us with brackets;
				<br>I plotted us, on an ABCD keyboard;
				<br>unfamiliar, out-of-bounds,
				<br>like so many weeknights last year.
				<br>but as I sat on the Ainslie porch,
				<br>and the chill snuck in my neck,
				<br>and I shivered,
				<br>I wondered if it felt different;
				<br>I don't remember much, or you;
				<br>I guess, gamble, grow my wrath.
				<br>And as I wait for what I've been waiting for,
				<br>I suddenly don't want to hear it,
				<br>and I don't want all those emails anymore.
				<br>Just leave me alone;
				<br>I don't want to live a lie
				<br>knowing this is what I loved.
