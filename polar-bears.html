    <h1>Polar Bears</h1>
				<p>As the earth quakes,
				<br>Splatter across dull niers;
				<br>Everything remains hidden in the crevices of a tragic tableau.
				<br>Darkness dawns
				<br>as an entity unseen makes its way
				<br>small indentations in the landscape
				<br>It carefully skins the layers of its cage
				<br>The absurd, leaking balloons turn solid.
				<br>Nothing transcribes as well as the pools of Lakewater
				<br>Carved by the blaze
				<br>worn away
				<br>little
				<br>by
				<br>little.
