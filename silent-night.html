    <h1>Silent Night</h1>
				<p>Tic-tac-toe with a pen,
        <br>Standing ovation,
        <br>What uses the bed when the sounds
        <br>pass, and strangled, the voices,
        <br>looming over my face, paralyzing
        <br>my legs, I cannot speak, I lean,
        <br>I pour out stale water, I try
				<br>So hard but it never works,
        <br>I shut down, jams in my
        <br>bronchial tubes, like a persistent
				<br>cough, a knot, a suspending drop
				<br>of Windex. How do I form
				<br>words? My mind blanks,
				<br>I listen but you lost me,
				<br>you lost me, why am I here?
