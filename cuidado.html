    <h1>Cuidado</h1>
				<p>There are holes everwhere,
				<br>and it's so hard to tell the difference.
				<br>sometimes,
				<br>as its hemline sags,
				<br>droops down to the floor,
				<br>I pull hard enough to derail the wall;
				<br>until my finger, too, is sanded;
				<br>until it feels like new things are in my bloodstream,
				<br>and the dryer wails in my ear, a siren
				<br>so insuffrable
				<br>I want to clip off the edges of everything;
				<br>until nothing can hurt me,
				<br>even as I constantly bump into so many things,
				<br>don't take notice;
				<br>As bruises come and fade in a week;
				<br>As myself becomes more and more versatile;
				<br>So my caution has grown,
				<br>and I tiptoe everywhere.
