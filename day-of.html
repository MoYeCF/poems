    <h1>Day of</h1>
				<p>Rough hives shave my skin
        <br>a painful slot of
        <br>melancholy and
        <br>thought
        <br>I wonder what you're like when you're happy
        <br>When I told you I know I've fallen in love
        <br>when I take an interest in anything you do,
        <br>I was lying. I was just glad to be done with it all.
        <br>In the darkness I wouldn't spot you
        <br>saturated in my thoughts
        <br>heaps of receipts
        <br>"take flight"
        <br>so many tires
        <br>I see light and I anticipate
        <br>and I can't help but wish I was someone else.
        <br>Gaze cast downward
        <br>eternally lonely, it seems
        <br>
      </p>
