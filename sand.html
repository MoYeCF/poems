    <h1>Sand</h1>
				<p>And you trembled,
        <br>and we sat on the beach.
        <br>For a moment I thought
				<br>you already knew.
				<br>But then you kissed my nose, looked in my eyes
				<br>and it was so obscene
				<br>I wanted to cry
				<br>and dig a hole in the sand
				<br>and bury myself. So I did.
				<br>And you shoved me, and I landed next to
				<br>a sea urchin, and you broke your skin
				<br>so I could kiss you,
				<br>and we fell apart on the shore.
