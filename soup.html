    <h1>Soup</h1>
				<p>I looked at you,
				<br>and as a last resort I asked you if you loved me.
				<br>"Yes," yes yes yes you say that to whatever I ask of you.
				<br>Can you please shut up.
				<br>and that night I decided to do some self-reflection.
				<br>And the answer was maybe, when it really should've been no.
				<br>Because my heart flatlined when I saw you, and you breathed life unto me;
				<br>I stayed away, and I forgot. There were many things I didn't notice, that night.
